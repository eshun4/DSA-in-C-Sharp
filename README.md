### C#'s main method
- The entry point for C# code is called the Main() method.
- It is the first method that gets invoked.
- The main method is always included in every C# executable file.

- The keyword `static` in front of main means that the Main() method can be called without an object.
- The keyword `void` means this method does not return a value.
- `Main()` is the name of the method an be sure to spell it with a capital m or else it wont work. Since no access modifier was specified this method is private by default.

### Variables in C#
- Variables store dat in computer Programs.
- Each variable consisits of 2 things a type and a value.
-  Every programming language has variables.
- The rules are the syntax of the programming language.
- We use the `=` sign to set the value of  a variable. This is also referred to as the assignment operator.
- You can name a variable any name that fits the rules of the language.
- In C#, the name can only contain letters, digits, and the underscore character (_).
- No other special characters are allowed in variable names.
- The first character must be a letter or underscore.
- C# is case-sensitive with variable names.
- Can't use keyword as variable names in C#.
- The main types of variables are: integers, floats, strings, cgaracters, and booleans.
- Integers are any positive or negative number.
- Floating point numbers have decimal values with suffix "f".
- Strings are letters, word, or sentences inside of double quotes.
- Characters are one character, within single quotes.
- Booleans can either be `True` or `False`.

### C# Conditional Statement
- Conditional statement allows the computer to decide which possibilty to execute among one or more possibilities.

### C# Loops
- A loop executes a piece of code repeatedly until a condition is fulfilled.
- Many of the programs you write involve loops.
- Only write the code once but run it over and over.
- 2 main types of loops: for loops and while loops.
- A for loop iterates over elements until the specified element is reaches.
- A while loop executes unitl a specified condition is met.
